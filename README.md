# pinewood-derby-car
## Code I wrote when I was 11 years old. It hasn't aged well :joy:

I wrote this for the cub scouts pinewood derby competition. [Here's](https://photos.app.goo.gl/YM3wEAjCiuDsBMW78) a video of the car in action.

It was some of the first C++ code I've ever written (and honestly some of the first code I've ever written).
Feel free to hold it up to public ridicule or use it as an example of what not to do. It's not useful for much else :+1:
